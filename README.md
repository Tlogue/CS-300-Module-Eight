# Binary-Search-Tree
This repository contains the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. The BST is utilized for organizing and managing bid information efficiently. The BST allows for insertion, removal, and searching of bids, providing flexibility and speed in handling bid data.
It contained a CSVparser.hpp for parsing data too. As well as a eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv that contained the information used by the Binary Tree Data Algorithm.

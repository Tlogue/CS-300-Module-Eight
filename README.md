For these two projects, we were solving how to implement the three data structures of Vector, Hash Table, and Tree. To identify when it is appropriate to use each one of the data structure algorithms for certain programs. I approached the problem by watching CS 50 videos on YouTube that were from Harvard plus free. Data structures are important to understand because they can affect a program's runtime and how a program can scale. I was able to overcome any roadblock I encountered by using various resources to help me better understand and retain the information such as YouTube, StackOverflow, and surprisingly TikTok. After completing this project I feel as if I have a better understanding of how the order of operations affects a program's performance. I am going to keep practicing with data structures in the future but now I feel as if I understand its impact at the very least.
